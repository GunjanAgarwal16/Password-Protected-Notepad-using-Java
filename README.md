# Password-protected-Notepad-using-JAVA

Notepad is a text editor, i.e., an app specialized in editing plain text. It can 
edit text files (bearing the ". txt" filename extension) and is compatible with formats, 
such as batch files, INI files, and log files. Notepad is text editor which can perform 
basic operations like changing the colour, style and size of the font. In this project, 
we can access the notepad with the help of our username and password. For the 
purpose of the same we have created a login page. If we have protected our notepad 
with password there is no chance that a third party person can have access to it.
